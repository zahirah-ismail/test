# ImmersionTalent

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Rules 

* You are allowed to use the internet.
* You have 30 minutes allocated to get the project set up and 2 hours to complete it.
* Projects should be on Github with a link pasted on the google sheets file [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXTT8yjWcxI8n_mR6qUmD9dF0sxeoL6fWrO1acXwGeU/edit?usp=sharing)
* Everything you need is already set up except jquery, bootstrap and popperJs.



# Resources

* [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/QAPxmYVgZ6a9yA9f37wtXbPT/ImmersionTalent)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis)
* The mock data can be found under the assets folder in the project.

# Criteria

* Focus on readable, modular code that scales to mobile (The lowest you should cater for is 320px wide). 
* The filter and switching of display format (Card or Table) are extra components  and don't necessarily need to be completed.
